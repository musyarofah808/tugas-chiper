# Laravel Chirper Demo
This repository contains a Blade implementation of the [Laravel Chirper](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/blade/installation) application with a few additional API endpoints. It serves as an example application for my testing workshop given at PHP[tek] 2023.

## Preparation
To prepare for the workshop, please:

- Clone this repository.
- Run `composer install`.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Ensure you can run the application locally.

You may use SQLite as the database driver for this project or any other driver you prefer. No other local environment configuration is required.

If you are new to Laravel or not familiar with some of the steps above, please take the time to do the _bootcamp_ for building [Laravel Chirper](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/blade/installation).
